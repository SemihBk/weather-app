## Report
I had to adapt my first fetch for the forecast weather.
First, i was using current weather data API and forecast weather data API, but i couldn't catch the perfect date and temperature of the next days.

So I restarted the fetch with one call API and geocoding API the 20th june 2022.
I made a simple design because I wanted a refined design. It's more lisible like that.


## What is missing
- Last user's choices data
- Allowing user to compare the weather of two cities
- The name of the day in forecast date
